# Portfolio
Alex Zook's portfolio webpage - a simple landing page with work samples, social links, and my resume.

## Deployment

![Mainpage Logo](https://github.com/anzook/Portfolio/blob/master/assets/images/logo/ANZ_Logo_Crop_Trans.png)

Pages include:
* Landing Page (index.html)

* index.js (main code for dynamic content)
* portfolio.js (array of projects for easy modification)

* index.css (basic modifications and animations on top of mdl)

## Updating

Please contact me with ways to improve, fix, or simply neat ideas to improve the site. If you wish to use this format, it can be easily updated and maintained by updating the portfolio.js file.
